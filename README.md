**HC-SR04 Distance Sensor** connected with the **Raspberry Pi 4** board we can easily detect distance. HC-SR04 has 4 points of connection (i)**VCC** which is connected to 5V power supply (ii)**Gnd** which can be connected to anyone of the Ground pins (iii) **Trigger** and **Echo** can be connected to any of the GPIO pins. **distance.py** contains source code for operating distance sensor with Raspberry Pi 4.
